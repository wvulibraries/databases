    <h2>Help with Databases</h2>
    <p> Most databases are available off-campus to current WVU-Morgantown students, faculty and
      staff. Licensing restrictions prevent WVU Libraries from providing off-campus access to
      others. Your affiliation with WVU is verified through use of WVU Login. You will be
      prompted to enter this when you choose a database from the menu. For assistance with
      WVU Login, please go to the Information Technology Services (ITS) website at:
      <a href="https://login.wvu.edu/">https://login.wvu.edu/</a>. There you can activate your
      account or change your password. Alternatively, you may call the ITS Help Desk at
      <a href="tel:3042934444">(304)293-4444</a>.
    </p>

    <p> If you need assistance with database selection or searching please contact us via <a href="http://westvirginia.libanswers.com/">Ask a Librarian</a>.</p>

    <p> If you are having a problem with a database or online resource, please submit an <a href="/report"> eResource Error Report</a>.</p>
