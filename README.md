# DOCUMENTATION
- This project uses YARD for its documentation.  It will allow you a quick glimpse at documentation on all logic associated with the project.
- To regenerate documentation in the command line type `yard doc`.  

# USE AND CONFIGURATION 

## EMAILING FEATURES 
In `config/environments` the `development.rb` and `production.rb` files need to be modified.  Currently they point to WVU's mailservers and instead they should point to whatever email server you intend to use.  Also verifying ports and other settings should be setup to your specific needs.   

## CAPTCHA 
In `config/initialiers` the `recaptcha.rb` may have to be modified.  To get the proper captcha fields you should use the `V2 Api` using [google's recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) interface.

## CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES 
There are some configuration items that were setup to be easy to use and very configurable for anyone with little technical expierience.  These are in the `config/application.yml`.

### Variables 
- Proxy URL
- CAS Authentication 
- Time Zone
- Campus IP Range  
- Deault HelpText / HelpURL
- Emails 

## Rake Tasks

```
rake search_index:database                              # Re-index databases
```

## RSPEC
We are using Rspec and Shoulda matchers in the backend for testing our models.

`RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec` will run the full test
`RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec {directory_path}` will run a specific subset of tests
`RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec {directory_path}/{test_name}` will run a single test.

## Application Setup
Databases code updates steps:
`git pull`
Then exec into app container (no need to shutdown) and do:
`bundle install`
`bundle clean` (optional)
`bin/rails db:create`
`bin/rails db:schema:load`
`bin/rails db:seed` (only for dev to load testing data)
`bin/rails assets:precompile`
`bin/rails restart`
`bin/rails search_index:database`
`bundle exec rake search_index:database`

# Loading MySql backup
Run the following from the host system after doing `bin/rails db:create` in the docker container.
`docker exec -i db mysql -u root -pdocker databases_development < ./mysql-files/{backup filename}.sql`
